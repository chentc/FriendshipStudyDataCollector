# FriendshipStudy Data Collector
An personal data collector implemented to study relationships.

## About

This data collector is built on top of the [PrivacyStreams](https://privacystreams.github.io/) library. All personal data related operations are made possible through simple PrivacyStreams API calls. 

## Credentials

As developer/researcher, you need to set up your dropbox developer account to get a Dropbox access token. For details, please refer to the [Dropbox official tutorial] (https://blogs.dropbox.com/developers/2014/05/generate-an-access-token-for-your-own-account/). In order not to commit the key on github, once you got the key, create a file locally called secrets.xml and put the access token in the file under the folder res/values.
